            <h2>Regrade Policy</h2>
            <p>
                Regrade requests must be submitted within one week of the assignment being returned.
                Requests must be made in writing, detailing the specific reasons for the regrade.
                The entire assignment will be regraded, which may result in a higher, lower, or unchanged grade.
                The decision of the instructor after the regrade is final.
